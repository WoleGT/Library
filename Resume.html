          <h2>Hello, my name is Wole George-Taylor<h2> 
          <h3>I’m a Full Stack Developer.</h3>
          <p>With 1 year of experience in web development, I have a strong command over both front-end and back-end technologies, allowing me to build complete and scalable applications.<br> On the front-end side, I specialize in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks such as React and Angular. I’m passionate about creating intuitive user interfaces that provide an <br> exceptional user experience. I pay great attention to detail, ensuring that the websites or applications I develop are responsive, visually appealing, and accessible across different<br> devices and browsers. 
           <br>
           <br> 
           Moving to the back end, I’m proficient in server-side languages like Python, Java, or Node.js. I have extensive experience working with databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL,<br> and MongoDB, and I can design efficient database structures and write optimized queries. I’m familiar with RESTful APIs and know how to integrate them into applications <br> to enable seamless communication between the front end and back end. 
           <br>
           <br>
           Additionally, I have expertise in version control systems like Git, and I’m comfortable working in collaborative environments using Agile methodologies. I enjoy staying up to date with the latest trends and technologies in the web development world, as it allows me to continually improve my skills and deliver cutting-edge solutions. Throughout my career, I’ve had the opportunity to work on various projects, ranging from small startups to large-scale enterprise applications. I thrive in dynamic environments where I can tackle challenges, collaborate with cross-functional teams, and deliver high-quality solutions that meet both user requirements and business objectives.<br> <br> I’m excited to be part of a team where I can contribute my full stack development skills and help create innovative and impactful applications.</p>
           Thank you for considering me, and I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to your organization.
